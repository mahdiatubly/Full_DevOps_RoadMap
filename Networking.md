# Networking

- The Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network. SMB relies on the TCP and IP protocols for transport. This combination potentially allows file sharing over complex, interconnected networks, including the public Internet. The SMB server component uses TCP port 445.(works on presentation layer)
- DHCP is an application layer protocol
- To get network interfaces on the host, use:

        $ip link
        # To get details about the ip that your pc uses
        $ip add
        # To reports interface statistics
        $ip -s link
        # To enable or disable an interface (These changes are not persistent and apply only to the running configuration, unless run as part of a startup script)
        $ip link set [inteface name] [up OR down]
        # To modify IP address config
        $ip [add OR delete]

- To sniff the packets on an interface:

        # To write the result to a file use => -w
        $tcpdump -i [interface name] -w [file name]
        # Intercepting traffic with tcpdump on other server:
        $sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -vv dst 10.1.16.12 and port http -w http.txt
        # Another example
        $sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -vv icmp -w ping.txt
        # To read the text file
        $sudo tcpdump -r http.txt

- To get the IP addr of a domain name:

        $nslookup [DN]
        # Or to get more details
        $dig [DN]

- APIPA Adress (Automatic Private IP Addressing): assigns a class B address from `169.254.0.0` to `169.254.255.255` to the client when DHCP server is either permanently or temporarly unavailable.
  -IGMP protocol is used in the multicas addressing to config group memebership & IP addresses.
- Anycast: Group of hosts with same IP, closest will be chosen.
- 0.0.0.0/8: commonly used by clients to request DHCP lease
- Nmap ("network mapper") is a very common and useful utility for discovering nodes on the network and scaning that node to discover open ports:

  $nmap [IP address]
  
- The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) does not encrypt network traffic or confirm the identity of the destination web server, hence the importance of HTTPS connectivity for secure web browsing.
- Ping uses ICMP(layer 3), which does not operate at the Transport layer (where port numbers exist).
- In Windows to change the IP of a host statically:

        $netsh interface ip set address "Ethernet" static 10.1.254.2 255.255.255.0 10.1.254.254

- A router to reach a 10.1.16.0/16 subnet from a 10.1.254.0/24 subnet, but it cannot reach the router configured as its default gateway (unsurprisingly, as it doesn't exist). This can produce a mix of Request timed out errors (because ARP cannot identify the default gateway) and Destination unreachable errors (because there is no other route in the local routing table)

- Applying inconsistent subnet masks may or may not break communications between hosts and can sometimes be difficult to identify. Hosts in the same subnet should be configured with the same mask, ideally from an autoconfiguration service such as DHCP.

- Ping the IP address of the local host to verify it was added correctly and to verify that the network adapter is functioning properly. If you cannot ping your own address, there might have been a configuration error, or the network adapter or adapter driver could be faulty.

- To show ARP cache contents.


        $arp -a (or arp -g )
        # Adds an entry to the ARP cache.
        $arp -s IPAddress MACAddress
        # To delete all entries in the ARP cache
        $arp -d *
        
- In Linux, the ip neigh command shows entries in the local ARP cache (replacing the old arp command).

- If ping probes are unsuccessful, one of two messages are commonly received (add -c to send a specific number of ping packets):

        - Destination host unreachable-There is no routing information (that is, the local computer does not
          know how to get to that IP address). This might be caused by some sort of configuration error on the
          local host, such as an incorrect default gateway, by a loss of connectivity with a router,
          or by a routing configuration error.
        - No reply (Request timed out.)-The host is unavailable or cannot route a reply to your computer. Requests
          time out when the TTL is reduced to 0 because the packet is looping (because of a corrupted routing table),
          when congestion causes delays, or when a host does not respond.
          
- If Windows detects a duplicate IP address, it will display a warning and disable IP. Linux does not typically check for duplicate IP addresses. If there are two systems with duplicate IPs, a sort of race condition will determine which receives traffic.

-  On Linux, you can use the arping tool `arping -D` to report duplicate replies.

- To diagnose MAC address issues, use the arp utility to verify the MAC addresses recorded for each host and ipconfig or ip neigh to check the MAC address assigned to the interface. Also check the MAC address and ARP tables on any switches and routers involved in the communications path. You can use a protocol analyzer to examine ARP traffic and identify which IP hosts are attempting to claim the same MAC address.

- In Windows, you can view the DNS servers using ipconfig /all. In Linux, the DNS server addresses are recorded in /etc/resolv.conf

- Multicast groups are established at layer 3 by protocols such as Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). IGMP snooping means the switch reads IGMP messages and can determine if the host on an access port or one or more hosts in a VLAN have joined a multicast group. Multicast traffic is filtered from ports and VLANs that have no hosts participating in the multicast group.

- In IPv6 The first 3 bits (001) indicate that the address is within the global scope.The next 45 bits are allocated in a hierarchical manner to regional registries and from them to ISPs and end users. The next 16 bits identify site-specific subnet addresses. The final 64 bits are the interface ID.

- In IPv6 Link local addresses span a single subnet (they are not forwarded by routers). In IPv6, an interface must always be configured with a link local address. One or more routable addresses can be assigned to the interface in addition to the link local address.

- The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol performs some of the functions on an IPv6 network that ARP and ICMP perform under IPv4. The main functions of ND are:
1. Address autoconfiguration-Enables a host to configure IPv6 addresses for its interfaces automatically and detect whether an address is already in use on the local network, by using neighbor solicitation (NS) and neighbor advertisement (NA) messages.
2. Prefix discovery-Enables a host to discover the known network prefixes that have been allocated to the local segment. This facilitates next-hop determination (whether a packet should be addressed to a local host or a router). Prefix discovery uses router solicitation (RS) and router advertisement (RA) messages. 
3. Local address resolution-Allows a host to discover other nodes and routers on the local network (neighbors). This process also uses neighbor solicitation (NS) and neighbor advertisement (NA) messages.
4. Redirection-Enables a router to inform a host of a better route to a particular destination.

- stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)(IPv6) == DHCP (IPv4)

- Error messaging-ICMPv6 supports the same sort of destination unreachable and time exceeded messaging as ICMPv4. One change is the introduction of a Packet Too Big class of error. Under IPv6, routers are no longer responsible for packet fragmentation and reassembly, so the host must ensure that they fit in the MTUs of the various links used.

-  Tunneling can be used to deliver IPv6 packets across an IPv4 network. Tunneling means that IPv6 packets are inserted into IPv4 packets and routed over the IPv4 network to their destination. Routing decisions are based on the IPv4 address until the packets approach their destinations, at which point the IPv6 packets are stripped from their IPv4 carrier packets and forwarded according to IPv6 routing rules. This carries a high protocol overhead and is not nearly as efficient as operating dual stack hosts.

-  Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE). GRE allows a wide variety of Network layer protocols to be encapsulated inside virtual point-to-point links. This protocol has the advantage that because it was originally designed for IPv4, it is considered a mature mechanism and can carry both v4 and v6 packets over an IPv4 network.

- Service (srv) records are essential for clients to be able to join a domain and authenticate with Active Directory.

-  Note that the switches do not count as hops

- Distance vector: Algorithm used by routing protocols that select a forwarding path based on the next hop router with the lowest hop count to the destination network.

-  Link state: Algorithm used by routing protocols that build a complete network topology to use to select optimum forwarding paths.

- A distance vector algorithm relies on directly connected neighbors for information about remote networks. By contrast, a link state algorithm allows a router to store the complete network topology and assess the least-cost paths from this topology database.

- Dynamic Routing: Entry in the routing table that has been learned from another router via a dynamic routing protocol.

- Convergence: Process whereby routers agree on routes through the network to establish the same network topology in their routing tables (steady state). The time taken to reach steady state is a measure of a routing protocolâ€™s convergence performance.

- A network under the administrative control of a single owner is referred to as an autonomous system (AS). An Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) is one that identifies routes within an AS.

- An Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) is one that can advertise routes between autonomous systems. An EGP includes a field to communicate the network's autonomous system ID and allows network owners to determine whether they can use paths through another organization's network.

- The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a distance vector routing protocol & IGP uses UDP on port 520 or 521. RIP only considers a single piece of information about the network topology-the next hop router to reach a given network or subnet (vector). It considers only one metric to select the optimal path to a given destination network-the one with the lowest hop count (distance). RIP sends regular updates (typically every 30 seconds) of its entire routing database to neighboring routers.

- RIPng (next generation) is a version of the protocol designed for IPv6. RIPng uses UDP port 521.

- Distance vector algorithms provide for slower convergence than link state algorithms. For more complex networks with redundant paths, other dynamic routing protocols should be considered.

- Enhanced IGRP (EIGRP)(There are versions for IPv4 and IPv6): is usually classed as an advanced distance vector or hybrid routing protocol. Like RIP, EIGRP is a distance vector protocol because it relies on neighboring routers to report paths to remote networks. Unlike RIP, which is based on a simple hop count metric, EIGRP uses a metric composed of administrator weighted elements. The two default elements are bandwidth and delay. Where RIP sends periodic updates of its entire routing information base, EIGRP sends a full update when it first establishes contact with a neighbor and thereafter only sends updates when there is a topology change.Unlike RIP, EIGRP is a native IP protocol, which means that it is encapsulated directly in IP datagrams, rather than using TCP or UDP. It is tagged with the protocol number 88 in the Protocol field of the IP header. Updates are transmitted using multicast addressing.

- Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)(IGP) is the most widely adopted link state protocol. It is suited to large organizations with multiple redundant paths between networks. It has better convergence performance than RIP.

-  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is designed to be used between routing domains in a mesh internetwork and as such is used as the routing protocol on the Internet, primarily between ISPs.

- Autonomous system numbers (ASN) are allocated to ISPs by IANA via the various regional registries. When BGP is used within an AS, it is referred to as Interior BGP (IBGP), and when implemented between autonomous systems, it is referred to as Exterior BGP (EBGP). BGP works with classless network prefixes called Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI). BGP works over TCP on port 179.

-  Administrative distance (AD): Metric determining the trustworthiness of routes derived from different routing protocols. Routers prefer the learned route because it has a lower AD.

-  Variable length subnet masking (VLSM): Using network prefixes of different lengths within an IP network to create subnets of different sizes. Without VLSM, you have to allocate subnetted ranges of addresses that are the same size and use the same subnet mask throughout the network. VLSM allows different length netmasks to be used within the same IP network, allowing more flexibility in the design process.

- Routers serve both to link physically remote networks and subdivide autonomous IP networks into multiple subnets. Router placement is primarily driven by the IP networks and subnets that have been created; Hosts with addresses in the same subnet or IP network must not be separated by a router.
Conversely, hosts with addresses in different subnets or IP networks must be separated by a router. Edge routers designed to work with DSL or cable broadband access methods are called small office/home office (SOHO) routers.

- An internal router has no public interfaces.

- Configuring a router's physical interface with multiple virtual interfaces connected to separate virtual LAN (VLAN) IDs over a trunk.

- Layer 3 capable switch: Switch appliance capable of IP routing between virtual LAN (VLAN) subnets using hardware-optimized path selection and forwarding.

-  SSH can be used to communicate with the router via the IP address of any configured interface.

- The route command is used to view and modify the routing table of end system Windows and Linux hosts. A nonpersistent route can be added using the following general syntax:

        $route add -net 192.168.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 metric 2 dev eth0
        
- `traceroute` is supported on Linux and router OSes (such as Cisco IOS). traceroute uses UDP probe messages by default. The command issues a UDP probe for port 32767 with a TTL of 1. The first hop should reduce this to zero and respond with an ICMP Time Exceeded message. The command then increments the TTL by one and sends a second probe, which should reach the second hop router. This process is repeated until the end node is reached, which should reply with an ICMP Port Unreachable response.
**The output shows the number of hops, the IP address of the ingress interface of the router or host (that is, the interface from which the router receives the probe), and the time taken to respond to each probe in milliseconds (ms). If no acknowledgment is received within the timeout period, an asterisk is shown against the probe. Note that while this could indicate that the router interface is not responding, it could also be that the router is configured to drop packets with expired TTLs silently.** traceroute can be configured to send ICMP Echo Request probes rather than UDP by using `traceroute -I` . The `traceroute -6` or `traceroute6` commands are used for IPv6 networks. On a Windows system, the same function is performed using the tracert command. `tracert` uses ICMP Echo Request probes by default. You can use the -d switch to suppress name resolution, -h to specify the maximum number of hops (the default is 30), and -w to specify a timeout in ms (the default is 4000).

- If you suspect a problem with router configuration and the network topology, use traceroute to try to identify where the network path is failing and the route or show route commands to investigate the routing tables of intermediate systems at that point in the path.

- missing route: Troubleshooting issue where a routing table does not contain a required entry due either to manual misconfiguration or failure of a dynamic routing protocol update.

- A routing loop occurs when two routers use one another as the path to a network. Packets caught in a routing loop circle around until the TTL expires. One symptom of a potential routing loop is for routers to generate ICMP Time Exceeded error messages.You can use traceroute to diagnose a routing loop by looking for IP addresses that appear multiple times in the output.

- Asymmetrical routing Topology where the return path is different to the forward path, Asymmetric routing is problematic where the return path is much higher latency than the forward path or where the difference between the paths causes stateful firewall or network address translation (NAT) devices to filter or drop communications. You should use traceroute from both sender and receiver to compare the per-hop latency to identify where the routing topology is misconfigured.

-  point-to-point: A point-to-point topology is one where two nodes have a dedicated connection to one another.

-  star topology: In a star network, each node is connected to a central point, typically a switch or a router. The central point mediates communications between the attached nodes. When a device such as a hub is used, the hub receives signals from a node and repeats the signal to all other connected nodes. Therefore the bandwidth is still shared between all nodes. When a device such as a switch is used, point-to-point links are established between each node as required. The circuit established between the two nodes can use the full bandwidth capacity of the network media.

- A topology often used in WANs where each device has (in theory) a point-to-point connection with every other device (fully connected); in practice, only the more important devices are directly interconnected (partial mesh).

- In a ring topology, all of the computers are connected in a circle. The ring comprises a series of point-to-point links between each device. Signals pass from device to device in a single direction with the signal regenerated at each device. The physical ring topology is no longer used on LANs, but it does remain a feature of many WANs.

- Bus topology: a shared access media where all nodes attach directly to a single cable segment.

- A network that uses a combination of physical or logical topologies. In practice most networks use hybrid topologies. For example, modern types of Ethernet are physically wired as stars but logically operate as buses. Nodes within the same logical bus segment are in the same collision domain. When Ethernet is deployed with a legacy hub appliance, this can be described as a physical star-logical bus topology.

-  spanning tree protocol (STP): Protocol that prevents layer 2 network loops by dynamically blocking switch ports as needed.

-  switching loop: Troubleshooting issue where layer 2 frames are forwarded between switches or bridges in an endless loop.

-  broadcast storm: Traffic that is recirculated and amplified by loops in a switching topology, causing network slowdowns and crashing switches.

- Normally, the network would be designed with a 1:1 mapping between VLANs and subnets.Implementing VLANs can reduce broadcast traffic

-  trunks: Backbone link established between switches and routers to transport frames for multiple virtual LANs (VLANs).

- A packet addressed to the loopback address can be received on any available hardware interface.

- The port number is used in conjunction with the source IP address to form a socket where it's a combination of a TCP/UDP port number and IP address. A client socket can form a connection with a server socket to exchange data. Each socket is bound to a software process. Only one process can operate a socket at any one time.

- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) works at the Transport layer to provide connection-oriented, guaranteed communication using acknowledgements to ensure that delivery has occurred. If packets are missing, they can be retransmitted. TCP can be used for unicast transmission only. CP takes data from the Application layer as a stream of bytes and divides it up into segments, each of which is given a header. The TCP segments become the payload of the underlying IP datagrams. The use of sequencing, acknowledgments, and retransmissions means that TCP requires numerous header fields to maintain state information. The main fields in the header of a TCP segment are: Source port, Destination port, Sequence number, Sequence number (A Negative Acknowledgement (NAK or NACK) forces retransmission.), Window (The amount of data the host is willing to receive before sending another acknowledgement.), etc.

- Servers can (usually) support thousands or even millions of TCP connections simultaneously.

- A host can also end a session abruptly using a reset (RST) segment. This would not be typical behavior and might need to be investigated. A server or security appliance might refuse connections using RST, a client or server application might be faulty, or there could be some sort of suspicious scanning activity ongoing.                                  
- UDP header size is 8 bytes, compared to 20 bytes (or more) for TCP.

-  IP scanner: Utility that can probe a network to detect which IP addresses are in use by hosts. IP scanning can be performed using lightweight standalone open source or commercial tools, such as Nmap, AngryIP, or PRTG. Windows Server is bundled with a DDI product. Other notable vendors and solutions include ManageEngine, Infoblox, SolarWinds, Bluecat, and Men -and- Mice.

-  Nmap Security Scanner: A highly adaptable, open-source network scanner used primarily to scan hosts and ports to locate services and detect vulnerabilities.

- The netstat command allows you to check the state of ports on the local host. You can use netstat to check for service misconfigurations, such as a host running a web or FTP server that a user installed without authorization. You may also be able to identify suspicious remote connections to services on the local host or from the host to remote IP addresses.On Linux, running netstat without switches shows active connections of any type. If you want to show different connection types, you can use the switches for Internet connections for TCP ( -t ) and UDP ( -u ), raw connections ( -w ), and UNIXÂ® sockets/local server ports ( -x ). Using the -a switch includes ports in the listening state in the output. -l shows only ports in the listening state, omitting established connections. For example, the following command shows listening and established Internet connections (TCP and UDP) only: netstat -tua. Another common task is to identify which software process is bound to a socket. On Windows, -o shows the Process ID (PID) number that has opened the port, while -b shows the process name. In Linux, use -p to show the PID and process name. netstat can also be set to run continuously. In Windows, run netstat nn , where nn is the refresh interval in seconds (press Ctrl+C to stop); in Linux, run netstat -c .

- Many of the tools used for host discovery can also perform remote port scanning. As with host discovery, there are many different techniques for performing port scans. Some techniques are designed for covert use (to try to avoid detection of the scanning activity by the target) and some are designed to probe beyond security barriers, such as firewalls.

- As examples, the following represent some of the main types of scanning that Nmap can perform:


        1. TCP SYN (-sS)-This is a fast technique (also referred to as half-open scanning) as the scanning host requests a connection without acknowledging it. The target's response to the scan's SYN packet identifies the port state.
        2. TCP connect (-sT)-A half-open scan requires Nmap to have privileged access to the network driver so that it can craft packets. If privileged access is not available, Nmap must use the OS to attempt a full TCP connection. This type of scan is less stealthy.
        3. UDP scans (-sU)-Scan UDP ports. As these do not use ACKs, Nmap needs to wait for a response or timeout to determine the port state, so UDP scanning can take a long time. A UDP scan can be combined with a TCP scan.
        4. Port range (-p)-By default, Nmap scans 1,000 commonly used ports. Use the -p argument to specify a port range. You can also use --top-ports n , where n is the number of commonly used ports to scan. The frequency statistics for determining how commonly a port is used are stored in the nmap-services configuration file.

When services are discovered, you can use Nmap with the -sV or -A switch to probe a host more intensively to discover the software or software version operating each port. The process of identifying an OS or software application from its responses to probes is called fingerprinting.

-  Protocol analyzer: Utility that can parse the header fields and payloads of protocols in captured frames for display and analysis. One function of a protocol analyzer is to parse each frame in a stream of traffic to reveal its header fields and payload contents in a readable format. This is referred to as packet analysis. Analyzing protocol data at the frame or packet level will help to identify protocol or service misconfigurations. As a live stream or capture file can contain hundreds or thousands of frames, you can use display filters to show only particular frame or sequence of frames. Another useful option is to use the Follow TCP Stream context command to reconstruct the packet contents for a TCP session.
Another function of a protocol analyzer is to perform traffic analysis. Rather than reading each frame individually, you use the tool to monitor statistics related to communications flows, such as bandwidth consumed by each protocol or each host, identifying the most active network hosts, monitoring link utilization and reliability, and so on. In Wireshark, you can use the Statistics menu to access traffic analysis tools.

- Sometimes, the DHCP lease process is called the DORA process: Discover, Offer, Request, and Ack(nowledge).

- Scope: Range of consecutive IP addresses in the same subnet that a DHCP server can lease to clients.

- A Windows client can be forced to release a lease by issuing a command such as ipconfig. In Linux, the utility dhclient is often used for this task, though modern distributions might use NetworkManager or systemd-networkd. A Windows host that fails to obtain a lease will revert to an automatic IP address (APIPA) or link-local configuration and select an address in the 169.254.0.0/16 range. Linux might use link-local addressing, set the address to unknown (0.0.0.0), or leave the interface unconfigured. 

- DHCP Options
When the DHCP server offers a configuration to a client, at a minimum it must supply an IP address and subnet mask. Typically, it will also supply other IP-related settings, known as DHCP options. Each option is identified by a tag byte or decimal value between 0 and 255 (though neither 0 nor 255 can be used as option values). Some widely used options include:

        The default gateway (IP address of the router).
        The IP address(es) of DNS servers that can act as resolvers for name queries.
        The DNS suffix (domain name) to be used by the client.
        Other useful server options, such as time synchronization (NTP), file transfer (TFTP), or VoIP proxy.
        
- A reservation is a mapping of a MAC address or interface ID to a specific IP address within the DHCP server's address pool.

-  IP helper: Command set in a router OS to support DHCP relay and other broadcast forwarding functionality.

- IPv6's Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) process can locate routers (default gateways) and generate a host address with a suitable network prefix automatically. In this context, the role of a DHCP server in IPv6 is different. DHCPv6 is often just used to provide additional option settings, rather than leases for host IP addresses. The format of messages is different, but the process of DHCP server discovery and address leasing (if offered) is fundamentally the same. As IPv6 does not support broadcast, clients use the multicast address ff02::1:2 to discover a DHCP server. DHCPv6 uses ports 546 (clients) and 547 (servers), rather than ports 68 and 67 as in DHCPv4.

-  An example of an FQDN might be nut.widget.example. An FQDN is made up of the host name and a domain suffix. In the example, the host name is nut and the domain suffix is widget.example. This domain suffix consists of the domain name widget within the top-level domain (TLD) .example . A domain suffix could also contain subdomains between the host and domain name. The trailing dot or period represents the root of the hierarchy. 

        The total length of an FQDN cannot exceed 253 characters, with each label
        (part of the name defined by a period) no more than 63 characters (excluding the periods).
        A DNS label should use letter, digit, and hyphen characters only. 
        A label should not start with a hyphen. Punctuation characters such as the period (.) or forward slash (/) should not be used.
        DNS labels are not case-sensitive.
        
- Iterative lookups: DNS query type whereby a server responds with information from its own data store only.

-  Recursive lookup: DNS query type whereby a server submits additional queries to other servers to obtain the requested information.

- Resource records: Data file storing information about a DNS zone. The main records are as follows: A (maps a host name to an IPv4 address), AAAA (maps to an IPv6 address), CNAME (an alias for a host name), MX (the IP address of a mail server), and PTR (allows a host name to be identified from an IP address).

- Authoritative name server: DNS server designated by a name server record for the domain that holds a complete copy of zone records.

- Authoritative name server: DNS server designated by a name server record for the domain that holds a complete copy of zone records.

- A Canonical Name (CNAME) (or alias) record is used to configure an alias for an existing address record (A or AAAA). For example, the IP address of a web server with the host record lamp could also be resolved by the alias www . CNAME records are also often used to make DNS administration easier. For example, an alias can be redirected to a completely different host temporarily during system maintenance. here is nothing to stop an administrator configuring multiple address records to point different host names to the same IP address. Using CNAME records is usually considered better practice, however. It is also possible to configure multiple A or AAAA records with the same host name but different IP addresses. This is usually done as a basic load balancing technique, referred to as round robin DNS.

-  Service (SRV) record contains the service name and port on which a particular application is hosted. SRV records are often used to locate VoIP or media servers. SRV records are also an essential part of the infrastructure supporting Microsoftâ€™s Active Directory; they are used by clients to locate domain controllers, for instance. As with MX, SRV records can be configured with a priority value.

- DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM): records are used to decide whether you should allow received email from a given source, preventing spam and mail spoofing. DKIM can use encrypted signatures to prove that a message really originated from the domain it claims.

- A reverse DNS query returns the host name associated with a given IP address. This information is stored in a reverse lookup zone as a pointer (PTR) record.
