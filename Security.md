# Security

- Symmetric cryptography systems:

1. DES (Old)
2. AES-GCM (symmetric) is used in TLS. During a TLS handshake, the client and server agree
   upon new keys to use for symmetric encryption, called "session keys." Each new communication session will start with a new TLS handshake and use new session keys.

- Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide
  communications security over a computer network. The protocol is widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use in securing HTTPS remains the most publicly visible.

- The session key: is the shared symmetric encryption key using TLS sessions to encrypt
  data being sent back and forth.

- Secure shell(SSH): is a secure network protocol that uses encryption to allow access to
  a network service over unsecured networks.

- When using public key authentication, a key pair is generated by the user who wants to
  authenticate. They then must distribute those public keys to all systems that they want to authenticate to using the key pair. When authenticating, SSH will ensure that the public key being presented matches the private key, which should never leave the user's possession.

- Pretty Good Privacy (PGP): is an encryption application that allows authentication of
  data along with privacy from third parties relying upon asymmetric encryption to achieve this. It's most commonly used for encrypted email communication, but
  it's also available as a full disk encryption solution or for encrypting arbitrary files, documents, or folders.

- Asymmetric cryptography systems:

1. RSA
2. DSA ( Digital Signature Algorithm )
3. DH(Diffie-Hellman): used for key exchange

- The benefit of elliptic curve based encryption systems is that they are able to achieve
  security similar to traditional public key systems with smaller key sizes. So, for example, a 256 bit elliptic curve key, would be comparable to a 3,072 bit RSA key. Both Diffie-Hellman and DSA have elliptic curve variants.

- MAC (Message Authentication Codes) is a bit of information that allows authentication of
  a received message, ensuring that the message came from the alleged sender and not a third party masquerading as them. It also ensures that the message wasn't modified in some way in order to provide data integrity. A MIC only hashes the message while a MAC incorporates a secret key.

- Hashing Algorithems:

1. MD5
2. SHA 1, 2, 3 (currently 3 is used)

- PKI is a system that defines the creation, storage anddistribution of digital
  certificates. A digital certificate is a file that proves that an entity owns a certain public key. A certificate contains information about the public key, the entity it belongs to and a digital signature from another party that has verified this information.

- Self Sign Certificate: This certificate has been signed by the same entity that issued  
  the certificate.This would basically be signing your own public key using your private key.Unless you already trusted this key, this certificate would fail to verify.

- SSL or TLS client certificate: This is an optional component of SSL, TLS connections and
  is less commonly seen than server certificates. As the name implies, these are certificates that are bound to clients and are used to authenticate the client to the server, allowing access control to a SSL, TLS service.

- code signing certificates which are used for signing executable programs. This allows
  users of these signed applications to verify the signatures and ensure that the application was not tampered with. It also lets them verify that the application came from the software author and is not a malicious twin.

- X.509 standard is what defines the format of digital certificates. It also defines a
  certificate revocation list or CRL which is a means to distribute a list of certificates that are no longer valid.
- IPsec, or Internet Protocol Security, is a VPN protocol that was designed in conjunction with IPv6. It was originally required to be standards compliant with IPv6 implementations,
  but was eventually dropped as a requirement.It is optional for use with IPv6. IPsec works by encrypting an IP packet and encapsulating the encrypted packet inside an IPsec packet.
  This encrypted packet then gets routed to the VPN endpoint where the packet is
  de-encapsulated and decrypted then sent to the final destination.

- IPsec supports two modes of operations, transport mode and tunnel mode. When transport mode is used, only the payload of the IP packet is encrypted,leaving the IP headers untouched. Heads up that authentication headers are also used. Header values are hashed and verified, along with the transport and application layers. This would prevent the use of anything that would modify these values,like NAT or PAT.In tunnel mode, the entire IP packet, header, payload, and all, is encrypted and encapsulated inside a new IP packet with new headers.While not a VPN solution itself, L2TP, or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, is typically used to support VPNs. A common implementation of L2TP is in conjunction with IPsec when data confidentially is needed, since L2TP doesn't provide encryption itself.
  It's a simple tunneling protocol that allows encapsulation of different protocols or
  traffic over a network that may not support the type of traffic being sent. L2TP can also just segregate and manage the traffic. ISPs will use the L2TP to deliver network access to a customer's endpoint,for example.The combination of L2TP and IPsec is referred to as L2TP IPsec and was officially standardized in ietf RFC 3193.

- The tunnel is provided by L2TP, which permits the passing of unmodified packets from one network to another. The secure channel, on the other hand, is provided by IPsec, which provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data being passed.

- SSL TLS is also used in some VPN implementations to secure network traffic, as opposed to individual sessions or connections. An example of this is OpenVPN, which uses the OpenSSL library to handle key exchange and encryption of data, along with control channels. OpenVPN can operate over either TCP or UDP, typically over port 1194. It can either rely on a Layer 3 IP tunnel or a Layer 2 Ethernet tap. The Ethernet tap is more flexible, allowing it to carry a wider range of traffic.

- Trusted Platform Module or TPM. This is a hardware device that's typically integrated into the hardware of a computer, that's a dedicated crypto processor. TPM offers secure generation of keys, random number generation, remote attestation, and data binding and sealing. A TPM has unique secret RSA key burned into the hardware at the time of manufacture, which allows a TPM to perform things like hardware authentication.

- Remote attestation is the idea of a system authenticating its software and hardware configuration to a remote system. This enables the remote system to determine the integrity of the remote system. This can be done using a TPM by generating a secure hash of the system configuration, using the unique RSA key embedded in the TPM itself.

- Binding and sealing. It involves using the secret key to derive a unique key that's then used for encryption of data. Basically, this binds encrypted data to the TPM and by extension, the system the TPM is installed in, sends only the keys stored in hardware in the TPM will be able to decrypt the data.

- Mobile devices have something similar referred to as a secure element. Similar to a TPM, it's a tamper resistant chip often embedded in the microprocessor or integrated into the mainboard of a mobile device. It supplies secure storage of cryptographic keys and provides a secure environment for applications.

- Trusted Execution Environment or TEE which takes the concept a bit further. It provides a full-blown isolated execution environment that runs alongside the main OS. This provides isolation of the applications from the main OS and other applications installed there. It also isolates secure processes from each other when running in the TEE.

- Full Disk Encryption or FDE,
as you might have guessed from the name,
is the practice of encrypting the entire drive in the system.
Not just sensitive files in the system.
This allows us to protect the entire contents of the disk from data theft or tampering. there are a bunch of options for implementing FDE.
Like the commercial product PGP,
Bitlocker from Microsoft, which integrates very well with TPMs,
Filevault 2 from Apple,
and the open source software dm-crypt,
which provides encryption for Linux systems.
